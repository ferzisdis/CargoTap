## Documentation Rules

**ONLY update documentation when explicitly requested by the user.**

### What NOT to do:
- ❌ Do NOT create implementation summaries
- ❌ Do NOT create changelogs
- ❌ Do NOT create quickstart guides
- ❌ Do NOT create feature-specific documentation files
- ❌ Do NOT create usage guides
- ❌ Do NOT create "SUMMARY", "COMPLETE", "FINAL" versions of docs
- ❌ Do NOT document every change made in a session

### What to do instead:
- ✅ Write clear, self-documenting code with good variable/function names
- ✅ Add inline comments ONLY for complex/non-obvious logic
- ✅ Update main README.md ONLY for significant user-facing features
- ✅ Keep the `src/renderer/README.md` for technical architecture (it's useful)
- ✅ Let the code speak for itself

### Documentation Philosophy:
- **Good code > Documentation**: Well-written code with clear names needs minimal docs
- **User-facing only**: Only document what users need to know, not implementation details
- **Minimal is better**: One good README is better than 20 scattered docs that nobody reads
- **Just-in-time**: Document when asked, not preemptively

### Remember:
The user said: "I don't expect that people will read this docs"

If you feel the urge to create a new .md file, STOP and ask yourself:
1. Did the user explicitly request this documentation?
2. Is this critical for end users?
3. Can this be a code comment instead?

If the answer to all three is NO, then DON'T create the file.

## Code Comments Guidelines

### When to add comments:
- Complex algorithms that aren't immediately obvious
- Workarounds for known issues/bugs
- Performance-critical sections with non-obvious optimizations
- Public API methods (brief doc comments)

### When NOT to add comments:
- Don't state the obvious: `// increment counter` for `counter += 1;`
- Don't document what the code already says clearly
- Don't add comments because "it seems professional"

## Summary

**CODE FIRST. DOCUMENT ONLY WHEN NECESSARY.**
